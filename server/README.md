To install you must start your own postgreSQL database and create your tables.

You must also create your own AWS S3 bucket and create your own config file that has your own S3 and RDS keys in it.

after that and cloning the server you can just run npm install.

The Back-End was built in NodeJS with express, AWS-sdk, axios, massive, socket.io, and postgreSQL for the database.
